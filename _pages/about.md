I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the [Hong Kong PolyU AIMS Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/hailong-huang/home?authuser=0), working under the guidance of Assistant Professor Hailong Huang. 
I received my Ph.D. degree from Nanjing University of Science and Technology, advised by Professor Liangmo Wang.
Previously,  I was a visiting student researcher in the [Energy Storage Lab](https://ziyousongthu.wixsite.com/website) under the supervision of Assistant Professor Ziyou Song.

My research focuses on the energy-saving optimization and safety-guaranteed driving of autonomous electrified vehicles.
The specific research points include reinforcement learning, human driving behavior modeling, mixed traffic and data-driven energy management of electrified vehicles.
I have published more than 10 papers in top journals and conferences.
